It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night. As finely made as the katana, the wakizashi, a shorter sword with a length between 12 and 24 inches, is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled user.

The dwarven smith Breagar has improved this weapon, so it won't break during a fight.

The ninjato is short with a straight blade, making it ideal for the subterfuge of the ninja. The ninjato is also more suited to fighting in closed places, sometimes giving the ninja an advantage over the longer blades that the samurai use.

Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.
