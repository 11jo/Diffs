Just one item from his astounding list of enchanted dungeoneering equipment is his Everlasting Torch.  A magical lantern fashioned in the shape of an elaborate wooden torch, the item burns with a bright orange flame that cannot be extinguished - whether dunked in water, buried under several feet of rock, or smashed over the head of a soggy marsh-troll, Belib's Everlasting Torch simply will not be put out.

When Belib finally finished the last of his items, he crammed them all into a giant pack - enchanted to hold far more than Belib could normally carry himself, of course - and heaved it onto his shoulders, prepared for the adventure of a lifetime.  As Belib crossed the threshold of his dwelling he tripped... and the tiny gnome was instantly crushed beneath his enormous backpack.  The bag burst open, its contents scattering across the Waterdeep street where Belib had lived and rapidly vanishing into the hands of various good-for-nothing passersby.

Belib's corpse was eventually taken to a temple and raised by a kind-hearted priestess, but by then the last of Belib's enchanted items... and most of the contents of his home... were long gone.  Grateful but understandably upset, Belib fashioned a number of unique magical items for the priestess before returning to his family and homeland, forever vanishing from the surface world.

As such, he needed a tool to keep his new recruits submissive and in line.  Thus, the Monkey Paw of Discipline was created.

The Monkey Paw of Discipline looks exactly like the name describes.  It consists mainly of a large, petrified monkey's arm severed at the shoulder.  At the shoulder joint, it looks like a one-handed grip was jammed into the bone and magically fused. At the opposite end, the paw is open and is the main dealer of pain.  Once someone is smacked with the paw, aside from the considerable damage, there is a chance that the recipient of the discipline will suffer from heightened fear and/or confusion.  Once these symptoms wear off, it is not likely that the recipient of the paw's discipline will ever be a problem in the future, especially while class is in session.

Its creation was the result of a blunder made during the commission of an enchanted item for Lodur the Brave (alternately known as Lodur Iron-Bollocks, Lodur the Foolhardy, and Lodur the Dullard), a powerful but none-to-bright cleric.  Lodur had of heard rumors of a mighty long-hafted hammer, possibly wielded by a hero known as Lucerne, or perhaps that's where it was made, which may or may not have had to do with a land or king or deity called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or "something of that nature, I am most certain."

"Oh," he had then added, "and pray thee bless it as well... thou dost know, that one where it explodes undead most explosively and what-not, so that I might get my most righteous smite on."

Lodur's fierce demeanor, violent reputation, and sacks of gold begged quiet compliance, and so the dwarven arms-master simply nodded and sent the cleric on his way, promising the weapon in two months' time.  The arm-master consulted with his clan's lore-master and sure enough, there *was* word of such a weapon: it came from a trader in Sigil by way of an exceptionally well-traveled plane-walker.  The arms-master dutifully copied the weapon's function and form, working runes of power into its haft and head just as Lodur had asked for.

When Lodur the Brave returned to the dwarven stronghold to pick up his new hammer, he found instead a spiked pole-arm whose use was forbidden by his religion.  The cleric ranted and gnashed his teeth and swore up and down the halls of the clan before stomping off in disgust, leaving his payment and the somewhat inappropriately named "Holy Swizarnian Hammer of Lucerne" behind.

Rage of Chaos has been known to turn the tide in many a battle.  Unfortunately, the victim often loses control of his or her faculties and flies into a state of confusion when struck by the weapon.  The chaotic powers of the blade also prevent the wielder from being controlled or confused in battle.

The history of Rage of Chaos is unknown.  The weapon has appeared throughout the realms in various battles over the centuries only to be lost once again.
