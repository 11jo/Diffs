Carefully detailed and layed upon both sides is also the symbol of Dumathoin, the Keeper of Secrets.

Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race, he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench that overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lengthy career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him.

Krotan was an exceptionally intelligent orc, as far as orcs go, who commanded an ever-shifting legion of ogres, orcs, hobgoblins, and other assorted beasties during the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241DR. It was in this year that a group of orc bandits allegedly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was a genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed, though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orc's called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."

Completely immune to any and all weapons used against him, Nysrogh rampaged throughout Amn, and Unileth took it upon herself to end the threat she had unleashed. Using her knowledge of the demon's weaknesses, she constructed a great club to defeat Nysrogh, and gave it to a brave but anonymous knight to be her champion.

Unileth's champion issued a challenge to Nysrogh, which the demon readily accepted, confident it could not be harmed by any weaponry known to the Realms. On the field of battle they met and beneath the fierce gaze of Nysrogh, Unileth's champion promptly dropped his weapon and fled in terror.

Nysrogh reached out to claim the champion's discarded club as a symbol of his victory. But as the demon's clawed hand touched the surface of the club, he unleashed a spell of imprisonment, for which he was completely unprepared. Unileth's ploy had worked, and the demon that could not be harmed by any weapon was forever trapped inside the magic club.

Weight: 10</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>This flail has been in the care of Lord de'Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord de'Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiates when assembled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity for magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, "losing" it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

If the fifth head for the Flail of Ages could be found, it would make this awesome weapon even more powerful.

Taking up the Hammer of Thunderbolts, he went to battle against the giant folk, and died valiantly.

Alone, the Hammer of Thunderbolts is a powerful magical weapon, but when merged with a pair of Gauntlets of Ogre Power and a Girdle of Giant Strength, it can be used to full effect. Crom Faeyr gifts its users with all the powers of the original recipients, effectively becoming one of the most fearsome weapon in the Realms.

It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night. As finely made as the katana, the wakizashi is a shorter sword with a length between 12 and 24 inches, and is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled user. Wu Jen masters have concealed within this wakizashi great power, unleashed only when the wielder is in the thick of battle. How or why this wakizashi made it to Faerûn is unknown, but if the samurai who owned it still lives, he will certainly be looking for it.

It saw use during the Battle of the Bones, but for which side is uncertain as it was found amongst the dead after a larger skirmish. Untransformed, the rod may serve as a powerful club with defensive enchantments, but its true power lies in the seven studlike buttons along its length that unlock the rod's magic. The first four of these buttons extend and transform the rod into alternative forms: a flail of disruption, a flaming long sword, a hypnotic axe, and a spear of speed. The final three buttons, rather than transforming the rod itself, instead activate powerful abilities: the first creates a ghastly spectre of the wielder, terrifying all those who see it; the second completely paralyzes another creature, rendering them helpess when pointed at; and lastly, the third directly sucks at the life of the target, healing the wielder of the rod.

The rod is currently transformed into a battle axe.

His tribe's battles against hordes of orcs, goblins, and hill giants are legendary throughout the north. Unfortunately for Pergad, the other tribes of the region decided to move south or settle in the cities of the north rather than fight against the seemingly endless waves of foes. Pergad's tribe, the Tribe of Dead Trees, was the last to make a stand. Though Pergad emerged victorious in a series of difficult battles, his tribe dwindled as quickly as the horde grew. At the Battle of Surbrin Shallows in 1014 DR, Pergad's tribe finally came to its end under cruel ogre clubs and giant-hurled rocks. Legend states that when Pergad finally realized that his tribe was doomed, he drove his trusted spear into the Surbrin riverbed, cursing all the goblins who crossed over the water that his people once thrived on. Orcish shamans claim that the spot where his spear penetrated the rock bled for days. A year later, two tribes of goblins were wiped out by a plague that spread among them after they settled in the Surbrin river valley. The spear subsequently disappeared in the river's currents, and was supposedly dragged into the open sea.

The Impaler has a palpable aura of magic that hints at the nature of the weapon and why it has been the bane of several powerful orc chieftains in the past. As one would guess, when a victim is struck, they are very nearly impaled as the massive enchantment does its dirty work.

From their outposts in the forbidding desert waste, the nomads raided merchant caravans and terrorized travelers who dared journey over the road from Calimport to Myratma.

Rumors and legends quickly spread about the invincible Ixil, who rode at the head of every raiding party brandishing his infamous magical spear. Some believe he was not truly a man, but a demon in human form, drawn to Faerûn by the chaos and confusion of the Time of Troubles.

Ixil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear. Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear... seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.

The warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.

Though Ixil's body was never found, Ixil's Spike, his fearsome spear and the symbol of his power, was recovered. In an effort to utterly destroy the artifact, it was shattered into several pieces, which were scattered about the Southlands. For many generations this magical shaft has been separated from Ixil's Spike, the enchanted head of the legendary spear. However, even incomplete, this artifact is still a weapon of great power.

Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear... seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.

The warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.

Though Ixil's body was never found, Ixil's Spike, his fearsome spear and the symbol of his power, was recovered. In an effort to utterly destroy the artifact, it was shattered into several pieces, which were scattered about the Southlands. With shaft and tip reunited, Ixil's Spike can now display its true potential.

From their outposts in the forbidding desert waste, the nomads raided merchant caravans and terrorized travelers who dared journey over the road from Calimport to Myratma.

Rumors and legends quickly spread about the invincible Ixil, who rode at the head of every raiding party brandishing his infamous magical spear. Some believe he was not truly a man, but a demon in human form, drawn to Faerûn by the chaos and confusion of the Time of Troubles.

Ixil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear.

Ilbratha was created by unknown hands at the behest of Azoun the First, long dead king of Cormyr. He bore it once into battle, at Ithmong in his war with Tethyr, and then lost it in a storm that wrecked his ship on the rocks of The Neck. All trace of it was lost until, 200 winters later, the sage Thallastam of Procampur was offered the blade for 1,500 gold pieces by a peddler from a nearby town who seemed ignorant of its true nature. Thallastam brought the blade to Elminster in Shadowdale, the only loremaster with an interest in swords whom he trusted. Elminster identified the blade from the writings of Azoun I (the old king's great-grandson had just come to the throne), and Thallastam bore it back toward Procampur by way of Tilver's Gap and Essembra. But he was never seen again, and did not reach Procampur. His ruined diary, staff, and a skeleton were found some years later when the Pool of Yeven in Battledale was dragged, but the sword was never found.

The form of manufacture is thought to be forgotten now -Elminster has heard of no one making one in the last 500 years- but there are over a dozen in existence.

Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge.

<tr><th class="title">SW1H51<br/>Celestial Fury +3</th><td class="description before"><pre>Many years ago, fierce tempests and fires ignited by lightning ravished the province administered by daimyo Hoshi Katahiroi. The daimyo's advisers, all respected shukenjas, soon divined that Nature was not to blame, but a powerful dragon of an unknown order. Some of the wise men suggested that the creature was an abomination; others believed that it was born of Primal Chaos before Kara-Tur was formed. All the advisers agreed to name it Celestial Fury.

Yet daimyo Hoshi did not want to categorize the scourge of his province; he wanted to destroy it. He commissioned the famed Chigatta (a reclusive artisan, master of mystic arts), to construct a weapon that might sunder the dragon's spirit as well as cleave its scaled body. Chigatta's labors resulted in the finest katana imaginable, dubbed Celestial Fury after the beast it was fashioned to destroy, and enchanted with the power of flight.

With this weapon, Hoshi sought his province's bane among the storm clouds. Shouts and roars resounded through the heavens for days, and forked fire lit up the nights. At long last, Hoshi destroyed the dragon's body and trapped its spirit within his sword, merging the two Celestial Furies and impressing order over chaos. To finalize his victory, Hoshi had Chigatta fashion a scabbard from the dragon's hide and embed its magic pearl in the hilt.

Yet the dragon had its revenge. Hoshi was skilled in battle but weak of will. Celestial Fury's spirit took control of Hoshi, forcing him to slay Chigatta and then slay himself. The katana subsequently disappeared (most likely, Hoshi's grieving family discarded the traitorous weapon) and has perhaps changed many hands in the years since.

Of course, even among those who follow dark gods, the pursuit of pleasure and emotional gratification often cause them to stray from their commandments. One priestess who strayed in such a fashion was Kalana Fisher. In 1357, she began a romance with the pirate captain Balhoderie. Though both were extremely flawed people with outrageous personalities and a complete lack of faithfulness, they had a strange mutual affection for each other. But while Balhoderie's great flaw was his mean temper, Kalana's was in holding grudges.

In 1366, Kalana tracked down the murderer of Balhoderie, a Talosian pirate captain named Madion. She planted information in Madion's spy network and anonymously offered him a tantalizing prize: three high-value merchant ships leaving the port of Baldur's Gate with few defenses. Low on money, Madion took the bait. He was slaughtered by the numerous guards that poured from the ships' holds.

As it had turned out, the merchant captain was a superstitious sort and had gone to the temple of Umberlee in Baldur's Gate for a divination. Without hesitation, the priestess Kalana had foretold a horrible attack outside the port. Not only did Kalana get her revenge, but the captain became a lifelong donator to the church of the Bitch Queen.

Nobody knows if Water's Edge, the blade Kalane had crafted for Balhoderie, was somehow retreived by the priestess herself or got lost in the ocean.

Cyric named the sword "Godsbane" because while he was a mortal, he used it to slay Bhaal (then Lord of Murder), and after becoming a deity, he used it to kill Leira, Lady of Deception.

The soon-to-become Prince of Lies also used it to kill Kelemvor Lyonsbane while atop Blackstaff Tower, but to spite Cyric for trying to break his will while he was a mortal, Mask as Godsbane hid Kelemvor's soul from him. During a revolt in the City of Strife that marked the end of Cyric's reign as Lord of the Dead, Cyric learned of this and snapped the blade in two. This revealed the sword to be an aspect of Mask, the god of thievery and intrigue. By doing this, Cyric greatly weakened Mask and gained the portfolio of intrigue, along with shadowy characteristics.

This revealed the sword to be an aspect of Mask, the god of thievery and intrigue. By doing this, Cyric greatly weakened Mask and gained the portfolio of intrigue, along with shadowy characteristics. For this, Mask hates Cyric, and he continuously plots ways to recover his lost portfolio.

Whether this blade is one of the original sword's reproductions, or another of Mask's attempts to seek his revenge is beyond anyone's knowledge.

Combined with the Heart of the Damned into a single lethal weapon, this deadly blade is now an unmatched tool of assassins and thieves.

The most powerful of six such enchanted blades Demron fashioned, Foebane can drain the very essence of life from its opponents with every blow, and bestow that life energy on the wielder. There are those who believe soul stealing capability has cursed the blade, for though fashioned as a weapon of right and justice, Foebane's dark history is one of murder and death.

Demron's own blood christened the blade, as a would be thief used the newly fashioned sword to bring about the Archmage's untimely death—though the thief did not survive the encounter, either. In the aftermath of Demron's murder, Foebane was recovered and presented to the hero Fflar to use in the defense of Myth Drannor, greatest of the elven cities.

Yet even the power of Foebane was not enough to withstand the dark hordes which overran Myth Drannor. When the elven city fell, Captain Fflar met a grisly, gruesome end and the sword itself was lost beneath the rubble of the once great metropolis.

Legend holds that Foebane's considerable powers are further augmented when the sword is reunited with the enchanted Scabbard of Fflar, its original owner.

As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance."

It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.

As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as, "Ouch, that musta hurt," "Oh yeah! Got 'im good," and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something," is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter.

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance and through mental discipline alone, the wielder must maintain the integrity of the blade.

For a brief but bloody time, the fighting pits of Luskan were home to a particularly vicious halfling who called herself "Flurry." Though her opponents were swift to underestimate her, they were quickly surprised by the speed of her attacks and the effectiveness of her strikes. As her reputation grew, Flurry grew reckless, allowing her opponents one free hit on her small frame—showing off to the crowd that she seemed to be unharmed by the blow—before viciously bludgeoning her opponent to death. In the end, it was Flurry's own ego that did her in: in a match where her speed and cunning could have bested her adversary easily, the free hit she allowed him with his scythe proved to be more effective than she had planned, and send her head tumbling into the dust.

When the last kensai of Kamjin-Doh, the Master of Razors, was slain in the fields of western Kara-Tur, these simple leather bands were ripped from his arms... and his arms ripped from his shoulders... as punishment for his destruction of the Kamjin-Doh. The identities of those who defeated him are not known, but the rumors in Kara Tur were that his slayers were the spirits of three sword saints of Kamjin-Doh, returned from death to end the crimes of the renegade kensai.

In the surviving teachings of the Kamjin-Doh of Kara-Tur, it is written that a true weapon master relies not on leather, chain, or plate, but on honing their skills so that they are never struck at all... and this means a weapon master must know their enemy's movements like the movements of their own hand. But such mastery lies in staying focused upon your enemy even in the heat of battle... and these simple leather armbands are intended to do just that. While worn, they exert a slight calming influence on the mind of the sword saint that wields them, heightening the warrior's perceptions and senses, and allowing them to read the movements of their opponents easier. On the rare occasion when an enemy strikes a sword saint, these bands allow the wielder to shrug off pain (which in the teachings of Kamjin-Doh are called "distractions") and keep the pain where it belongs—on one's opponent.

If you wear these bands, never forget their purpose, never forget your focus, and never forget the reach of your enemy. Keep these three things in your heart, and they will serve you well in battle.

If you wear these bands, never forget their purpose, never forget your focus, and never forget the reach of your enemy. Keep these three things in your heart, and they will serve you well in battle.

Warriors of these clans rely on agility and quick movements instead of pure strength and they get across the battlefield like a whirlwind. Barbarian shamans would sometimes create spells that would temporarily imbue the warriors with inhuman quickness and fleetness of foot. However, since these spells were temporary, often times the spell would wear off at inopportune times.

Thus a group of barbarian shamans once congregated to find a way to better harness the swift agility of the cheetah. For nearly a year the shamans remained out of sight from their home clans, busily focusing their attentions towards the magic to create such items. Then one day, the shamans returned to their respective clans, each holding a small necklace, with a pendant that resembled a cheetah's paw. The shamans gave this pendant to their strongest warrior of each clan. Once placed around the neck of the warrior, the speed of the cheetah filled their powerful bodies. From then on, the Amulet of Cheetah Speed, as it became known, would become one of the most prized artifacts within barbarian clans. Only the mightiest warriors wore the amulet, and it became the goal of all young warriors to one day be adorned with an amulet such as this.

To their annoyance, he continually used the wood to escape the law, and with the aid of this girdle, the elves' arrows as well. Unfortunately for Pandar, pit-traps and starvation proved a slower, but effective, substitution.

The famous barbarian explorer Graena was a member of the Sky Pony tribe of the Uthgardt northerners. When she tried to leave the tribe to seek her fortune in southern lands, the elders of the tribe told her she could not leave. At that time, only men were allowed to leave the tribe. The elders believed women were too valuable to let go. In order to prove herself to the elders, Graena had to run a gauntlet of the strongest warriors in the tribe and wrest the belt of the head warrior from his body. Graena underwent the challenge and emerged bloody and broken, but victorious. According to tribal law, she was now the head warrior of the tribe and effectively male. The elders knew she was going to leave, but they gave her a warrior's name, Graena Blood-Has-Dried. She left the tribe, relinquished her position to the old head warrior, and returned his belt to him. But before she left, she swore to never harm a member of the tribe if she encountered one in the future.

Years later, she looked back on that fateful day and felt pride in the fact that she had beaten the greatest men of her tribe. She had a girdle constructed that looked identical to the one she had won. Not content to stop there, she had a priest of Tempus bless it with a powerful enchantment.

Although civilized areas were affected considerably, the true victims were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those who remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land, taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed upon the item its ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

Weight: 3</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. Although civilized areas were affected considerably, the true victims were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those who remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land, taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed upon the item its ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

NOTE: The Root of the Problem is always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.

Completely immune to any and all weapons used against him, Nysrogh rampaged throughout Amn, and Unileth took it upon herself to end the threat she had unleashed. Using her knowledge of the demon's weaknesses, she constructed a great club to defeat Nysrogh, and gave it to a brave but anonymous knight to be her champion.

Unileth's champion issued a challenge to Nysrogh, which the demon readily accepted, confident it could not be harmed by any weaponry known to the Realms. On the field of battle they met and beneath the fierce gaze of Nysrogh, Unileth's champion promptly dropped his weapon and fled in terror.

Nysrogh reached out to claim the champion's discarded club as a symbol of his victory. But as the demon's clawed hand touched the surface of the club, he unleashed a spell of imprisonment, for which he was completely unprepared. Unileth's ploy had worked, and the demon that could not be harmed by any weapon was forever trapped inside the magic club.

This dark, two-handed sword radiates evil from a distance. The weapon is not just unholy, but unearthly as well. Long thought to be just a myth, the blade's infamy pervades the accounts of learned bards and ancient sages. According to these accounts, the githyanki wizard-smith Ir'mlar forged the blade many centuries ago in dark caverns deep beneath Tu'narath. This githyanki city floats in the Astral Plane upon the petrified corpse of a dead god know only as "the One in the Void." To craft the sword, Ir'mlar allegedly used the One's own bones, which consist of a metallic substance unknown on the Prime Material Plane. The smith then imbued the weapon with a fiendish entity whom some seers claim was a mighty prince of the lower plane of Carceri. Others claim the sword contains the One in the Void's own spirit, banished within the blade for crimes committed against other gods in past ages. In any case, Ir'revrykal possess such an enmity against good that only blackguards committed to evil may wield it. Circular runes etched on the blade proclaim its name in ancient tir'su, the githyanki language. The runes translate roughly as "Pain-Servant."

In their efforts to find more and more darksteel, the Clangeddin delved ever deeper into the bowels of the earth.

It was on one such expedition that the seven sons of Argeld Heavyhand, the Clangeddin leader, were lost. The only survivor from the ill-fated expedition was Glimred Heavyhand, youngest son of Argeld. The lad returned with tales of drow and illithid and other darker, nameless horrors the like of which had never before been seen.

Desperate as he was to avenge his sons, Argeld could not send more of his people down into the depths of the mountain to face such horrors. Glimred himself, however, could not be dissuaded. To aid Glimred in his quest for vengeance, the dwarven smiths set about constructing the Darksteel Shield, a heavily enchanted shield that provides more protection than most suits of armor.

But Glimred was impatient, his lust for vengeance could not be deferred, and he disappeared into the bowels of the Marching Mountains before the work was completed, never to be seen again. The disappearance and presumed death of his sole surviving son proved too much for Argeld, who died from the grief of a broken heart.

With their leader dead and their hero Glimred gone, the dwarves knew it was only a matter of time before their clan was overrun by their Underdark enemies. Before dispersing across the face of Faerûn, the clan sold the shield to the highest bidder—though the dwarven smiths to this day have refused to divulge the mysterious buyer's identity.

His tribe's battles against hordes of orcs, goblins, and hill giants are legendary throughout the north. Unfortunately for Pergad, the other tribes of the region decided to move south or settle in the cities of the north rather than fight against the seemingly endless waves of foes. Pergad's tribe, the Tribe of Dead Trees, was the last to make a stand. Though Pergad emerged victorious in a series of difficult battles, his tribe dwindled as quickly as the horde grew. At the Battle of Surbrin Shallows in 1014 DR, Pergad's tribe finally came to its end under cruel ogre clubs and giant-hurled rocks. Legend states that when Pergad finally realized that his tribe was doomed, he drove his trusted spear into the Surbrin riverbed, cursing all the goblins who crossed over the water that his people once thrived on. Orcish shamans claim that the spot where his spear penetrated the rock bled for days. A year later, two tribes of goblins were wiped out by a plague that spread among them after they settled in the Surbrin river valley. The spear subsequently disappeared in the river's currents, and was supposedly dragged into the open sea.

The Impaler has a palpable aura of magic that hints at the nature of the weapon and why it has been the bane of several powerful orc chieftains in the past. As one would guess, when a victim is struck, they are very nearly impaled as the massive enchantment does its dirty work.

From their outposts in the forbidding desert waste, the nomads raided merchant caravans and terrorized travelers who dared journey over the road from Calimport to Myratma.

Rumors and legends quickly spread about the invincible Ixil, who rode at the head of every raiding party brandishing his infamous magical spear. Some believe he was not truly a man, but a demon in human form, drawn to Faerûn by the chaos and confusion of the Time of Troubles.

Ixil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear. Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear... seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.

The warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.

Though Ixil's body was never found, Ixil's Spike, his fearsome spear and the symbol of his power, was recovered. In an effort to utterly destroy the artifact, it was shattered into several pieces, which were scattered about the Southlands. For many generations this magical shaft has been separated from Ixil's Spike, the enchanted head of the legendary spear. However, even incomplete, this artifact is still a weapon of great power.

Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers. In his loneliness, he spent many hours alone on the hills overlooking Trademeet. There Galloma, a wizard living in the area, discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul. The two fast became friends, and more: they were master and apprentice. Galloma died before Dramnek's apprenticeship could be completed, however, and the youth found himself once more alone in the world. Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla. There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma. Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced his weak body.

This ancient bronze sword is set with six matching bloodstones, and gains its name from its illusionary powers, which are very useful in combat.

Ilbratha was created by unknown hands at the behest of Azoun the First, long dead king of Cormyr. He bore it once into battle, at Ithmong in his war with Tethyr, and then lost it in a storm that wrecked his ship on the rocks of The Neck. All trace of it was lost until, 200 winters later, the sage Thallastam of Procampur was offered the blade for 1,500 gold pieces by a peddler from a nearby town who seemed ignorant of its true nature. Thallastam brought the blade to Elminster in Shadowdale, the only loremaster with an interest in swords whom he trusted. Elminster identified the blade from the writings of Azoun I (the old king's great-grandson had just come to the throne), and Thallastam bore it back toward Procampur by way of Tilver's Gap and Essembra. But he was never seen again, and did not reach Procampur. His ruined diary, staff, and a skeleton were found some years later when the Pool of Yeven in Battledale was dragged, but the sword was never found.

The first of these swords were created by the elf wizard, Lord Arbane of Myth Drannor many centuries ago. His first was stolen, so he made a second with the aid of an apprentice, who sold the secret to two other wizard-swordsmiths. The form of manufacture is thought to be forgotten now -Elminster has heard of no one making one in the last 500 years- but there are over a dozen in existence. Some have even been created with sentience and further powers.

One of many created in the name of the mage who first discovered how to enchant a blade in this manner, this was the weapon of the outlaw Garno, and many a cleric died at its edge. Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge. Despite his focussed hatred of the devout, it is thought that one of the gods of chaos had a hand in Garno's acquisition of this sword, delighting in the havoc that followed the young man.

On one side of the blade is etched in Common "Namarra," and on the other face "Never Sleep." Namarra appears in many legends and tall tales, but the designation the "Neversleep Sword" appears to be derived only from the inscription on the blade and does not refer to any specific property of the sword. Its origin is unknown; Namarra appears to have existed for long as tales have survived, wielded by such mythic heroes as Eth and Brensyl the Tall. Even the most critical of sages (Kurmur the Skeptic, First Speaker of Evernoster) cannot determine Namarra's probable time of origin or find any references in the tales of a word to a time "before Namarra was forged."

This ancient blade is thought to have been present at some of the most influential conflicts in Faerûn's history. Sightings have been noted as far north as Thay and as far south as the jungles of Chult, though documentation is oddly lacking regarding the details. This is perhaps a result of the sword's ability to silence all sound within a large radius, removing the effectiveness of attacking mages, but also preventing any discussion that might have followed.

The daimyo's advisers, all respected shukenjas, soon divined that Nature was not to blame, but a powerful dragon of an unknown order. Some of the wise men suggested that the creature was an abomination; others believed that it was born of Primal Chaos before Kara-Tur was formed. All the advisers agreed to name it Celestial Fury.

Yet daimyo Hoshi did not want to categorize the scourge of his province; he wanted to destroy it. He commissioned the famed Chigatta (a reclusive artisan, master of mystic arts), to construct a weapon that might sunder the dragon's spirit as well as cleave its scaled body. Chigatta's labors resulted in the finest katana imaginable, dubbed Celestial Fury after the beast it was fashioned to destroy, and enchanted with the power of flight.

With this weapon, Hoshi sought his province's bane among the storm clouds. Shouts and roars resounded through the heavens for days, and forked fire lit up the nights. At long last, Hoshi destroyed the dragon's body and trapped its spirit within his sword, merging the two Celestial Furies and impressing order over chaos. To finalize his victory, Hoshi had Chigatta fashion a scabbard from the dragon's hide and embed its magic pearl in the hilt.

Yet the dragon had its revenge. Hoshi was skilled in battle but weak of will. Celestial Fury's spirit took control of Hoshi, forcing him to slay Chigatta and then slay himself. The katana subsequently disappeared (most likely, Hoshi's grieving family discarded the traitorous weapon) and has perhaps changed many hands in the years since.

Of course, even among those who follow dark gods, the pursuit of pleasure and emotional gratification often cause them to stray from their commandments. One priestess who strayed in such a fashion was Kalana Fisher. In 1357, she began a romance with the pirate captain Balhoderie. Though both were extremely flawed people with outrageous personalities and a complete lack of faithfulness, they had a strange mutual affection for each other. But while Balhoderie's great flaw was his mean temper, Kalana's was in holding grudges.

In 1366, Kalana tracked down the murderer of Balhoderie, a Talosian pirate captain named Madion. She planted information in Madion's spy network and anonymously offered him a tantalizing prize: three high-value merchant ships leaving the port of Baldur's Gate with few defenses. Low on money, Madion took the bait. He was slaughtered by the numerous guards that poured from the ships' holds.

As it had turned out, the merchant captain was a superstitious sort and had gone to the temple of Umberlee in Baldur's Gate for a divination. Without hesitation, the priestess Kalana had foretold a horrible attack outside the port. Not only did Kalana get her revenge, but the captain became a lifelong donator to the church of the Bitch Queen.

Nobody knows if Water's Edge, the blade Kalane had crafted for Balhoderie, was somehow retreived by the priestess herself or got lost in the ocean.

Godsbane was the sword form assumed by Mask during the Time of Troubles. He would eventually come to be wielded by the then-mortal Cyric, who acquired the sword by murdering a halfling named Sneakabout, who in turn killed the former wielder of the sword.

Cyric named the sword "Godsbane" because while he was a mortal, he used it to slay Bhaal (then Lord of Murder), and after becoming a deity, he used it to kill Leira, Lady of Deception.

The soon-to-become Prince of Lies also used it to kill Kelemvor Lyonsbane while atop Blackstaff Tower, but to spite Cyric for trying to break his will while he was a mortal, Mask as Godsbane hid Kelemvor's soul from him. During a revolt in the City of Strife that marked the end of Cyric's reign as Lord of the Dead, Cyric learned of this and snapped the blade in two. This revealed the sword to be an aspect of Mask, the god of thievery and intrigue. By doing this, Cyric greatly weakened Mask and gained the portfolio of intrigue, along with shadowy characteristics. For this, Mask hates Cyric, and he continuously plots ways to recover his lost portfolio.

Whether this blade is one of the original sword's reproductions, or another of Mask's attempts to seek his revenge is beyond anyone's knowledge.

<tr><th class="title">sw2h14<br/>Lilarcor +3</th><td class="description before"><pre>Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance."

It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.

As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as, "Ouch, that musta hurt," "Oh yeah! Got 'im good," and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something," is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

Weight: 8</pre></td><td class="description after"><pre>Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance."

It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.

As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as, "Ouch, that musta hurt," "Oh yeah! Got 'im good," and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something," is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

Then he set sail for Anchorome once more, not to been seen again to this day. His money was well-spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.

This plate was worn by the famous hero Balduran. It is part of a set of weapons and armor that was stolen from the museum in the city of Baldur's Gate. No one really knows what fate befell Balduran, the founder of Baldur's Gate, but people never grow tired of speculating. When his personal armor was found on the Sword Coast—supposedly recovered and sold by a group of adventurers—it only served to spark interest in him once again, and several copies of the suit were made to accommodate collectors and historians. In this way, it could be said, Balduran obtained a measure of immortality.

Then he set sail for Anchorome once more, not to been seen again to this day. His money was well-spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.

This plate was worn by the famous hero Balduran. It is part of a set of weapons and armor that was stolen from the museum in the city of Baldur's Gate. No one really knows what fate befell Balduran, the founder of Baldur's Gate, but people never grow tired of speculating. When his personal armor was found on the Sword Coast—supposedly recovered and sold by a group of adventurers—it only served to spark interest in him once again, and several copies of the suit were made to accommodate collectors and historians. In this way, it could be said, Balduran obtained a measure of immortality.
