During a tremendous battle against these demon hordes, one of her command decisions resulted in the destruction of a quarter of her legions. Furious over the loss, she abandoned her post and waded into battle herself, cutting down lesser demons by the dozen. Though she was personally victorious in combat, the larger battle was lost‚Äîwithout her leadership, her remaining forces were thrown into disarray and forced to withdraw. For dereliction of duty and her inability to control her emotions, the god she served stripped her of her rank and cast her out of her home plane.

This dark, two-handed sword radiates evil from a distance. The weapon is not just unholy, but unearthly as well. Long thought to be just a myth, the blade's infamy pervades the accounts of learned bards and ancient sages. According to these accounts, the githyanki wizard-smith Ir'mlar forged the blade many centuries ago in dark caverns deep beneath Tu'narath. This githyanki city floats in the Astral Plane upon the petrified corpse of a dead god know only as "the One in the Void." To craft the sword, Ir'mlar allegedly used the One's own bones, which consist of a metallic substance unknown on the Prime Material Plane. The smith then imbued the weapon with a fiendish entity whom some seers claim was a mighty prince of the lower plane of Carceri. Others claim the sword contains the One in the Void's own spirit, banished within the blade for crimes committed against other gods in past ages. In any case, Ir'revrykal possess such an enmity against good that only blackguards committed to evil may wield it. Circular runes etched on the blade proclaim its name in ancient tir'su, the githyanki language. The runes translate roughly as "Pain-Servant."

With their leader dead and their hero Glimred gone, the dwarves knew it was only a matter of time before their clan was overrun by their Underdark enemies. Before dispersing across the face of Faer√ªn, the clan sold the shield to the highest bidder‚Äîthough the dwarven smiths to this day have refused to divulge the mysterious buyer's identity.

His tribe's battles against hordes of orcs, goblins, and hill giants are legendary throughout the north. Unfortunately for Pergad, the other tribes of the region decided to move south or settle in the cities of the north rather than fight against the seemingly endless waves of foes. Pergad's tribe, the Tribe of Dead Trees, was the last to make a stand. Though Pergad emerged victorious in a series of difficult battles, his tribe dwindled as quickly as the horde grew. At the Battle of Surbrin Shallows in 1014 DR, Pergad's tribe finally came to its end under cruel ogre clubs and giant-hurled rocks. Legend states that when Pergad finally realized that his tribe was doomed, he drove his trusted spear into the Surbrin riverbed, cursing all the goblins who crossed over the water that his people once thrived on. Orcish shamans claim that the spot where his spear penetrated the rock bled for days. A year later, two tribes of goblins were wiped out by a plague that spread among them after they settled in the Surbrin river valley. The spear subsequently disappeared in the river's currents, and was supposedly dragged into the open sea.

The Impaler has a palpable aura of magic that hints at the nature of the weapon and why it has been the bane of several powerful orc chieftains in the past. As one would guess, when a victim is struck, they are very nearly impaled as the massive enchantment does its dirty work.

<tr><th class="title">SPER11<br/>Ixil's Nail +4</th><td class="description before"><pre>Shortly after the Time of Troubles began the nomadic bandit tribes of the Calimshan desert were united under a single leader; a cruel and brutal giant of a man, the warlord Ixil Xaxsha. From their outposts in the forbidding desert waste, the nomads raided merchant caravans and terrorized travelers who dared journey over the road from Calimport to Myratma.

Rumors and legends quickly spread about the invincible Ixil, who rode at the head of every raiding party brandishing his infamous magical spear. Some believe he was not truly a man, but a demon in human form, drawn to Faer√ªn by the chaos and confusion of the Time of Troubles.

Ixil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear. Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear... seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.

The warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.

From their outposts in the forbidding desert waste, the nomads raided merchant caravans and terrorized travelers who dared journey over the road from Calimport to Myratma.

Rumors and legends quickly spread about the invincible Ixil, who rode at the head of every raiding party brandishing his infamous magical spear. Some believe he was not truly a man, but a demon in human form, drawn to Faer√ªn by the chaos and confusion of the Time of Troubles.

Ixil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear. Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear... seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.

The warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.

Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak.

That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth.

It was in this year that a group of orc bandits allegedly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was a genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed, though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried.

Completely immune to any and all weapons used against him, Nysrogh rampaged throughout Amn, and Unileth took it upon herself to end the threat she had unleashed. Using her knowledge of the demon's weaknesses, she constructed a great club to defeat Nysrogh, and gave it to a brave but anonymous knight to be her champion.

Unileth's champion issued a challenge to Nysrogh, which the demon readily accepted, confident it could not be harmed by any weaponry known to the Realms. On the field of battle they met and beneath the fierce gaze of Nysrogh, Unileth's champion promptly dropped his weapon and fled in terror.

Nysrogh reached out to claim the champion's discarded club as a symbol of his victory. But as the demon's clawed hand touched the surface of the club, he unleashed a spell of imprisonment, for which he was completely unprepared. Unileth's ploy had worked, and the demon that could not be harmed by any weapon was forever trapped inside the magic club.

The crude wooden club still burns with the raging spirit of the demon forever trapped within by the powerful enchantments placed on the weapon. Occasionally, however, the demon's wrath manages to escape in a fiery blast.

It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord de'Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiates when assembled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity for magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, "losing" it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

Using specimens pulled from the deepest pits of the ocean, the Imaskari spellcasters slowly began to graft these magically-enhanced creatures onto suits of plate mail, weaning them off of salt water and forcing them to rely on magic for nourishment. This technique worked well, allowing the user a far greater resistance to spells than normal... but other magewrights looked upon this creation with a growing fear, worried that a creature that fed on magic might soon grow too hungry and feed upon its masters instead. Because of this, only a few suits of this armor were ever made, and the creatures created by the Imaskari sealed away and forgotten.

The living symbiote feeds itself with low level spells and consumes them in the process, thus making the wearer completely immune to their effects. Unfortunately, it doesn't distinguish between harmful and friendly magic, but at least doesn't seem to interfere with spells cast by the wearer.

Using specimens pulled from the deepest pits of the ocean, the Imaskari spellcasters slowly began to graft these magically-enhanced creatures onto suits of plate mail, weaning them off of salt water and forcing them to rely on magic for nourishment. This technique worked well, allowing the user a far greater resistance to spells than normal... but other magewrights looked upon this creation with a growing fear, worried that a creature that fed on magic might soon grow too hungry and feed upon its masters instead. Because of this, only a few suits of this armor were ever made, and the creatures created by the Imaskari sealed away and forgotten.

The living symbiote feeds itself with low level spells and consumes them in the process, thus making the wearer completely immune to their effects. Unfortunately, it doesn't distinguish between harmful and friendly magic, but at least doesn't seem to interfere with spells cast by the wearer.

It saw use during the Battle of the Bones, but for which side is uncertain as it was found amongst the dead after a larger skirmish. Untransformed, the rod may serve as a powerful club with defensive enchantments, but its true power lies in the seven studlike buttons along its length that unlock the rod's magic. The first four of these buttons extend and transform the rod into alternative forms: a flail of disruption, a flaming long sword, a hypnotic axe, and a spear of speed. The final three buttons, rather than transforming the rod itself, instead activate powerful abilities: the first creates a ghastly spectre of the wielder, terrifying all those who see it; the second completely paralyzes another creature, rendering them helpess when pointed at; and lastly, the third directly sucks at the life of the target, healing the wielder of the rod.

The rod is currently untransformed.

Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers. In his loneliness, he spent many hours alone on the hills overlooking Trademeet. There Galloma, a wizard living in the area, discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul. The two fast became friends, and more: they were master and apprentice. Galloma died before Dramnek's apprenticeship could be completed, however, and the youth found himself once more alone in the world. Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla. There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma. Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced his weak body.

Ilbratha was created by unknown hands at the behest of Azoun the First, long dead king of Cormyr. He bore it once into battle, at Ithmong in his war with Tethyr, and then lost it in a storm that wrecked his ship on the rocks of The Neck. All trace of it was lost until, 200 winters later, the sage Thallastam of Procampur was offered the blade for 1,500 gold pieces by a peddler from a nearby town who seemed ignorant of its true nature. Thallastam brought the blade to Elminster in Shadowdale, the only loremaster with an interest in swords whom he trusted. Elminster identified the blade from the writings of Azoun I (the old king's great-grandson had just come to the throne), and Thallastam bore it back toward Procampur by way of Tilver's Gap and Essembra. But he was never seen again, and did not reach Procampur. His ruined diary, staff, and a skeleton were found some years later when the Pool of Yeven in Battledale was dragged, but the sword was never found.

The first of these swords were created by the elf wizard, Lord Arbane of Myth Drannor many centuries ago.

The form of manufacture is thought to be forgotten now -Elminster has heard of no one making one in the last 500 years- but there are over a dozen in existence. Some have even been created with sentience and further powers.

One of many created in the name of the mage who first discovered how to enchant a blade in this manner, this was the weapon of the outlaw Garno, and many a cleric died at its edge. Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge. Despite his focussed hatred of the devout, it is thought that one of the gods of chaos had a hand in Garno's acquisition of this sword, delighting in the havoc that followed the young man.

He sought treasures and glory, but soon all he wanted were companions to share in the excitement of battle, much like those he had left behind in his faraway village. Unfortunately, his coarse remarks and rudimentary hygiene repelled most travelers he met, until he expressed his thoughts to a sympathetic mage. The mage, for a price, constructed Ras, the dancing blade. Though not quite what Beroalf had in mind, he was thrilled nonetheless and wielded the sword for many years. How they were ultimately separated is not known.

Amrok was of almost human stature, and it has often been said Adjatha is of human and not dwarven manufacture, for it is of the full size and heft for a strong long-armed human swordsman.

The blade was stolen from the palace vaults in the sack of Aumreayum on the death of Kurskos, and since then The Drinker has changed hands often over the years, usually remaining with any one owner for only a short time. Elminster saw Adjatha 40 winters ago at the court of Nesker of Mulmaster, when the sorcerer-king was studying it to increase his own arts. It disappeared before Nesker's death and came to light briefly in reports of fighting in the Shaar, apparently being wielded by one of the nomad chieftains.

On one side of the blade is etched in Common "Namarra," and on the other face "Never Sleep." Namarra appears in many legends and tall tales, but the designation the "Neversleep Sword" appears to be derived only from the inscription on the blade and does not refer to any specific property of the sword. Its origin is unknown; Namarra appears to have existed for long as tales have survived, wielded by such mythic heroes as Eth and Brensyl the Tall. Even the most critical of sages (Kurmur the Skeptic, First Speaker of Evernoster) cannot determine Namarra's probable time of origin or find any references in the tales of a word to a time "before Namarra was forged."

This ancient blade is thought to have been present at some of the most influential conflicts in Faer√ªn's history. Sightings have been noted as far north as Thay and as far south as the jungles of Chult, though documentation is oddly lacking regarding the details. This is perhaps a result of the sword's ability to silence all sound within a large radius, removing the effectiveness of attacking mages, but also preventing any discussion that might have followed.

<tr><th class="title">SW1H51<br/>Celestial Fury +3</th><td class="description before"><pre>Many years ago, fierce tempests and fires ignited by lightning ravished the province administered by daimyo Hoshi Katahiroi. The daimyo's advisers, all respected shukenjas, soon divined that Nature was not to blame, but a powerful dragon of an unknown order. Some of the wise men suggested that the creature was an abomination; others believed that it was born of Primal Chaos before Kara-Tur was formed. All the advisers agreed to name it Celestial Fury.

Yet daimyo Hoshi did not want to categorize the scourge of his province; he wanted to destroy it. He commissioned the famed Chigatta (a reclusive artisan, master of mystic arts), to construct a weapon that might sunder the dragon's spirit as well as cleave its scaled body. Chigatta's labors resulted in the finest katana imaginable, dubbed Celestial Fury after the beast it was fashioned to destroy, and enchanted with the power of flight.

With this weapon, Hoshi sought his province's bane among the storm clouds. Shouts and roars resounded through the heavens for days, and forked fire lit up the nights. At long last, Hoshi destroyed the dragon's body and trapped its spirit within his sword, merging the two Celestial Furies and impressing order over chaos. To finalize his victory, Hoshi had Chigatta fashion a scabbard from the dragon's hide and embed its magic pearl in the hilt.

Yet the dragon had its revenge. Hoshi was skilled in battle but weak of will. Celestial Fury's spirit took control of Hoshi, forcing him to slay Chigatta and then slay himself. The katana subsequently disappeared (most likely, Hoshi's grieving family discarded the traitorous weapon) and has perhaps changed many hands in the years since.

Of course, even among those who follow dark gods, the pursuit of pleasure and emotional gratification often cause them to stray from their commandments. One priestess who strayed in such a fashion was Kalana Fisher. In 1357, she began a romance with the pirate captain Balhoderie. Though both were extremely flawed people with outrageous personalities and a complete lack of faithfulness, they had a strange mutual affection for each other. But while Balhoderie's great flaw was his mean temper, Kalana's was in holding grudges.

In 1366, Kalana tracked down the murderer of Balhoderie, a Talosian pirate captain named Madion. She planted information in Madion's spy network and anonymously offered him a tantalizing prize: three high-value merchant ships leaving the port of Baldur's Gate with few defenses. Low on money, Madion took the bait. He was slaughtered by the numerous guards that poured from the ships' holds.

As it had turned out, the merchant captain was a superstitious sort and had gone to the temple of Umberlee in Baldur's Gate for a divination. Without hesitation, the priestess Kalana had foretold a horrible attack outside the port. Not only did Kalana get her revenge, but the captain became a lifelong donator to the church of the Bitch Queen.

Nobody knows if Water's Edge, the blade Kalane had crafted for Balhoderie, was somehow retreived by the priestess herself or got lost in the ocean.

Cyric named the sword "Godsbane" because while he was a mortal, he used it to slay Bhaal (then Lord of Murder), and after becoming a deity, he used it to kill Leira, Lady of Deception.

During a revolt in the City of Strife that marked the end of Cyric's reign as Lord of the Dead, Cyric learned of this and snapped the blade in two. This revealed the sword to be an aspect of Mask, the god of thievery and intrigue. By doing this, Cyric greatly weakened Mask and gained the portfolio of intrigue, along with shadowy characteristics.

There are those who believe soul stealing capability has cursed the blade, for though fashioned as a weapon of right and justice, Foebane's dark history is one of murder and death.

Perhaps the strange circumstances of his death preserved this blade, as it would otherwise have lost its form when his will no longer shaped it.

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter.

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance and through mental discipline alone, the wielder must maintain the integrity of the blade. He can shape it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, sharpness of the edge and to a lesser extent, its magical properties. Presumably more powerful and experienced minds may be able to manipulate the blade in new ways.
