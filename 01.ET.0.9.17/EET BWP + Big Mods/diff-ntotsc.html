Drosus fell afoul to an unusually large group of winter wolves on a solo expedition into the Spine of the World Mountains, having been forced to don a heavier cloak to keep out the cold.

At first glance this cloak appears to be blinding white in color. However, it is in fact a composite of thousands of colors, which dance and play in any available light source. This barrage of scintillating colors tends to distract and partially blind anyone staring directly at the wearer.

This cloak can be worn in combination with any other form of enchanted protection - thus it can be worn over magical armor unlike a Cloak of Protection.
