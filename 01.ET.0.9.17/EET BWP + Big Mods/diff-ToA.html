<tr><th class="title">Z_HACK<br/>Hackmaster +12</th><td class="description before"><pre>The legendary Hackmaster

A weapon as it occurs only in a bold dreams. But no matter how hard you tried this idea from wave
 only as a legend, so real she is. Just like their real face, sounds incredible.
Anyone who has kept even the equally legendary Lilarcor in his hands, knows the statement that "My brother is a Hackmeister +12" represents also the truth.
Before they became swords were both living humans, Lawrence Lilarcor the sucker the village and Andrew Lilarcor the highly respected warrior and blacksmith of the village.
The story really begins with the legendary Andrews (primarily to stop stupid) Quest of the Treefolk. Initially, Andrew still had to cut his sorry state underexposed brother, but after he began more and more, and without ever having to have a reason to, he went himself only on my nerves.
Lawrence He had warned against the Treefolk search that the villagers had thought it just a bad joke, and drove with him. But Lawrence wanted them to hear and they set out.
When Lawrence "successfully" returned with an old tree uprooted, began like many know the legend of Lilarcor, which occurred in every history and legend, personified as the idiot in appearance.
And that was the major problem: everywhere where people told stories about stupidity was the name Lilarcor, but never the full name!
Andrew, his brother had suffered most under this circumstance. Though he was the blacksmith of the village and everyone knew what was meant by Lilarcor, but at the same time he was a warrior of the long summer often travels around the country undertook to acquire new techniques of swordsmanship, as well as increase his powers.
But since those "Tragedies", in his opinion, he encounters throughout the Sword Coast, only meets with ridicule and scorn, statements that his brother was responsible fall on deaf ears.
Without significant achievements or quest in the land of Andrew broke his journey at an early stage and repaired back to his homeland. Once there, the villagers were ready for him as a great surprise, Lawrence hailed as a hero! All cried out, "Lawrence, the troll-slayer!". No one was more about his brother, funny, and none dared even raise this issue. 
Andrew could have brought a positive turn on this point in history, and it would be over. But which was unfortunately not so, rather than relying on the (very) unexpected happy success of his brother, ate his hatred of Lawrence even deeper into his heart and let it harden. He, Andrew was the great hero of the village and respected warrior of the Sword Coast, not Lawrence! Nevertheless, he enjoyed the exploits in his homeland, while Andrew got from one disappointment to the others, and returned home frustrated.
Andrew asked his brother to talk about how such things could occur, after which Lawrence talked about a strange Mage, and he passed on the "Guide of the warrior." After months of study (it is much more difficult to understand the words in it ) he had the guide through and stuck to the instructions after which he was a very short time much stronger.
One day a group of trolls, and wanted the unprotected village to overrun. The villagers knew indeed to help themselves, but with a whole host of trolls, they had never had anything to do. But Lawrence kept a cool head, slaughtered the trolls, prompting the villagers with torches pounce on them and kill them for good. Thus he became the hero known as "Lawrence of troll-slayer".
It passed a few more weeks and the hate always sprouted more and more, not just once Lawrence had smeared him his heroism under his nose and made fun of him, in Lawrence's eyes was the village idiot and now he no longer was.
If a hunt Andrew is simply too much, Lawrence had ruined his life, no, it had stolen from him, he lived the life that he deserved, so he fought with his brother and tried to kill him in the forest. Both were good Fighters, and now it was long until one of them won the upper hand, now you can no longer say which of the brothers was there, but it does not matter. The other brother managed to escape at the last moment as he fell back, but unfortunately there was a slope at the other brother, clutching both fell into the deep in an unknown part of the forest. Andrew still barely alive and spat poison and gall and tried everything to kill his brother, even though he would not survive.
Then came the sorcerers past Lawrence who had paid the guide and was therefore responsible for its strength. When he watched as the two tried to kill each other, he said angrily: "I have not given Lawrence Lilarcor this power to outdo your brother, I have given you the opportunity as the invincible Lilarcor brothers, the heroes of the Sword Coast in history respond! But I find you over here?! You want to fight? You want to kill? then so be it, I'll give you that opportunity until the end of eternity!" And with these words, both brothers were turned into swords.

Here ends the sad story about the brothers Lilarcor and knows the reason for their transformation. Lawrence as one is still swaggering as sword and nerve killing, but not malignant.
In marked contrast to his brother, Andrew. Since he has been transformed in a moment of pure hatred in a sword, he has taken this hatred in his new form, and only this and nothing else. His humanity, then disappeared completely, so, unlike Lawrence, he says nothing as a sword. Full of hatred and blood lust is one of the most powerful known Hackmeister swords, with many features that are lethal even in the course of time perfecting has appropriated only to the killing even more. However, it is just as dangerous for the wearer. The hatred and the thirst for blood transmitted to the carrier, which is why even the most upright good man who could do with this sword in his hands the most heinous atrocities without remorse shown. Furthermore, the insatiable thirst for blood so that it escapes even his own institution, the life force to quench his thirst, not just one who was too weak for the sword, who died this to have been wounded in the hand of without an enemy. 
Because transmissible fury of the sword to its wearer falls, that sometimes in such a frenzy that he attacks you and everyone on it incessantly hacking until he is dead, hence the name; Hackmeister. Many have tried to destroy the cursed sword, but so far none have managed.

 only as a legend, so real she is. Just like their real face, sounds incredible.
Anyone who has kept even the equally legendary Lilarcor in his hands, knows the statement that "My brother is a Hackmeister +12" represents also the truth.
Before they became swords were both living humans, Lawrence Lilarcor the sucker the village and Andrew Lilarcor the highly respected warrior and blacksmith of the village.
The story really begins with the legendary Andrews (primarily to stop stupid) Quest of the Treefolk. Initially, Andrew still had to cut his sorry state underexposed brother, but after he began more and more, and without ever having to have a reason to, he went himself only on my nerves.
Lawrence He had warned against the Treefolk search that the villagers had thought it just a bad joke, and drove with him. But Lawrence wanted them to hear and they set out.
When Lawrence "successfully" returned with an old tree uprooted, began like many know the legend of Lilarcor, which occurred in every history and legend, personified as the idiot in appearance.
And that was the major problem: everywhere where people told stories about stupidity was the name Lilarcor, but never the full name!
Andrew, his brother had suffered most under this circumstance. Though he was the blacksmith of the village and everyone knew what was meant by Lilarcor, but at the same time he was a warrior of the long summer often travels around the country undertook to acquire new techniques of swordsmanship, as well as increase his powers.
But since those "Tragedies", in his opinion, he encounters throughout the Sword Coast, only meets with ridicule and scorn, statements that his brother was responsible fall on deaf ears.
Without significant achievements or quest in the land of Andrew broke his journey at an early stage and repaired back to his homeland. Once there, the villagers were ready for him as a great surprise, Lawrence hailed as a hero! All cried out, "Lawrence, the troll-slayer!". No one was more about his brother, funny, and none dared even raise this issue. 
Andrew could have brought a positive turn on this point in history, and it would be over. But which was unfortunately not so, rather than relying on the (very) unexpected happy success of his brother, ate his hatred of Lawrence even deeper into his heart and let it harden. He, Andrew was the great hero of the village and respected warrior of the Sword Coast, not Lawrence! Nevertheless, he enjoyed the exploits in his homeland, while Andrew got from one disappointment to the others, and returned home frustrated.
Andrew asked his brother to talk about how such things could occur, after which Lawrence talked about a strange Mage, and he passed on the "Guide of the warrior." After months of study (it is much more difficult to understand the words in it ) he had the guide through and stuck to the instructions after which he was a very short time much stronger.
One day a group of trolls, and wanted the unprotected village to overrun. The villagers knew indeed to help themselves, but with a whole host of trolls, they had never had anything to do. But Lawrence kept a cool head, slaughtered the trolls, prompting the villagers with torches pounce on them and kill them for good. Thus he became the hero known as "Lawrence of troll-slayer".
It passed a few more weeks and the hate always sprouted more and more, not just once Lawrence had smeared him his heroism under his nose and made fun of him, in Lawrence's eyes was the village idiot and now he no longer was.
If a hunt Andrew is simply too much, Lawrence had ruined his life, no, it had stolen from him, he lived the life that he deserved, so he fought with his brother and tried to kill him in the forest. Both were good Fighters, and now it was long until one of them won the upper hand, now you can no longer say which of the brothers was there, but it does not matter. The other brother managed to escape at the last moment as he fell back, but unfortunately there was a slope at the other brother, clutching both fell into the deep in an unknown part of the forest. Andrew still barely alive and spat poison and gall and tried everything to kill his brother, even though he would not survive.
Then came the sorcerers past Lawrence who had paid the guide and was therefore responsible for its strength. When he watched as the two tried to kill each other, he said angrily: "I have not given Lawrence Lilarcor this power to outdo your brother, I have given you the opportunity as the invincible Lilarcor brothers, the heroes of the Sword Coast in history respond! But I find you over here?! You want to fight? You want to kill? then so be it, I'll give you that opportunity until the end of eternity!" And with these words, both brothers were turned into swords.

Here ends the sad story about the brothers Lilarcor and knows the reason for their transformation. Lawrence as one is still swaggering as sword and nerve killing, but not malignant.
In marked contrast to his brother, Andrew. Since he has been transformed in a moment of pure hatred in a sword, he has taken this hatred in his new form, and only this and nothing else. His humanity, then disappeared completely, so, unlike Lawrence, he says nothing as a sword. Full of hatred and blood lust is one of the most powerful known Hackmeister swords, with many features that are lethal even in the course of time perfecting has appropriated only to the killing even more. However, it is just as dangerous for the wearer. The hatred and the thirst for blood transmitted to the carrier, which is why even the most upright good man who could do with this sword in his hands the most heinous atrocities without remorse shown. Furthermore, the insatiable thirst for blood so that it escapes even his own institution, the life force to quench his thirst, not just one who was too weak for the sword, who died this to have been wounded in the hand of without an enemy. 
Because transmissible fury of the sword to its wearer falls, that sometimes in such a frenzy that he attacks you and everyone on it incessantly hacking until he is dead, hence the name; Hackmeister. Many have tried to destroy the cursed sword, but so far none have managed.
